# MediaPlayer
A media player that plays audiovisual recordings while displaying a survey on a second monitor. Synchronization between the survey and media player is achieved using codes named receiver, sender, and mqttclient. This allows for conducting perception studies on audio-visual stimuli and saving results to a text file.
